* Overview and Goals
** Document Structure
This exporter is intended to provide a lot of flexibility through plain ConTeXt
code with minimal elisp intervention. The output ConTeXt is structured to have
as much setup code as possible in the document preamble and in general
formatting instructions won't appear in the document body beyond simple semantic
markers. In other words, unless you provide additional markup directives in the
=org= file, there won't be any additional inline styling in the output ConTeXt
file.
** Customization
Customization can occur at three different levels of granularity. The coarsest
control is the /preset/ which is set by the ~#+CONTEXT_PRESET~ directive and is
most similar to the LaTeX class. The next level of control is with /snippets/
which are predefined pieces of code that the user can define. For instance, the
user can select just the ~layout-article~ snippet to select a page layout
similar to the default LaTeX article. The lowest level of control is provided by
inserting literal ConTeXt code directly into the document using
~#+CONTEXT_HEADER~, ~#+CONTEXT_HEADER_EXTRA~, and ~#+CONTEXT~ directives.

Additional configuration can be inserted into the document preamble by using
preset, snippet, or literal directives to customize the display of any of the
different elements of the document.
** Compatibility
This exporter is intended to provide as much compatibility as is reasonable with
options and configuration for the LaTeX exporter.

* Features
** DONE [#A] Block Elements
CLOSED: [2021-01-25 Mon 14:57]
This section demonstrates different elements delimited by different
~#+BEGIN/END~ tags.
*** Source Blocks
#+INDEX: Source Block
#+INCLUDE: ./source.org
*** Verse Blocks
By default, verse blocks are enclosed in a custom ~\lines~ environment called
~OrgVerse~ that can be customized by adding\\
~#+CONTEXT_HEADER_EXTRA: \setuplines[OrgVerse][...]~.

/The Monks and the Giants/ by John Hookham Frere
#+CAPTION: The Monks and the Giants
#+BEGIN_VERSE
But chiefly, when the shadowy moon had shed
  O'er woods and waters her mysterious hue,
Their passive hearts and vacant fancies fed
    With thoughts and aspirations strange and new,
Till their brute souls with inward working bred
     Dark hints that in the depths of instinct grew
Subjection not from Locke's associations,
      Nor David Hartley's doctrine of vibrations.
#+END_VERSE
*** Example Blocks
#+INDEX: Example Block
By default, example blocks are enclosed in a custom ~\typing~ environment
called ~OrgExample~ that can be customized by adding\\

#+NAME: pythozen
#+CAPTION: The Zen of Python
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

** Inline Elements
*** Code
Here's some code: ~with open("file.txt") as f:~
  
*** Links
#+INCLUDE: ./links.org
*** Bold
This is *Some bold text*
*** LaTeX Fragments
Here's some inline LaTeX: $e=m c^2$
*** Inline Source
Here's some python source: src_python[:exports code]{print("Hello, world!")} and here's the rest of the line
*** Italic
/This is some italic text/
*** Line breaks
Here is a line\\
break
*** Strikethrough
+This is strikethrough+
*** Subscripts

*** Superscripts
This^is super^script
*** Underline
_Here's some underlined text_
*** Verbatim

*** Smart Quotes
Smart quotes are formatted using the ~\quote~ and ~\quotation~ macros, which
respect language settings.

Here's an English quotation: "Here's a 'nested' quote"

#+CONTEXT: \language[cz]

Here's a Czech quotation: "Here's a 'nested' quote"
   
#+CONTEXT: \language[en]

*** Clock
The default clock is set to use the ISO format. ConTeXt doesn't provide
a locale-aware timestamp but the user can customize the clock appearance
by overriding the ~\OrgClock~ macro. Example:
CLOCK: [2021-01-15 Fri 16:58]

*** Timestamp
Timestamps are supported by the ~\date~ macro, so different locales
are supported.

Here's an English timestamp: <2021-01-15 Fri>

#+CONTEXT: \language[fr]
Here's a French timestamp: <2021-01-15 Fri>
#+CONTEXT: \language[en]

*** Citations
#+INCLUDE: ./citations.org
    
** Paragraph Elements
These elements form their own paragraph or section in the export.
*** Tables
#+INCLUDE: ./tables.org

*** Images
#+INCLUDE: ./images.org

*** Headlines
#+INCLUDE: ./headlines.org
*** Equations
#+INCLUDE: ./equations.org

*** Inline Task
Inline tasks are supported by a custom ~\OrgInlineTask~ macro. Arguments to the
macro include the todo keyword, the todo type, the priority, the name of the
task, tags, and contents.

Alternatively, for higher-level customization, the user can
provide their own\\
~org-context-format-inlinetask-function~.

*** Fixed width
Fixed-width text is enclosed in a custom ~typing~ environment called ~OrgFixed~
by default. To customize this environment,\\
add ~#+CONTEXT_HEADER_EXTRA: \setuptyping[OrgFixed][...]~ to the document.

~OrgPropertyDrawer~ by default. To customize this environment,\\
add ~#+CONTEXT_HEADER_EXTRA: \setuptyping[OrgPropertyDrawer][...]~ to the

*** Lists and items
Standard bulleted lists are enclosed in an ~itemize~ environment. Description
lists use a custom ~description~ element called ~OrgDesc~. Additionally,
checkbox items use custom macros called ~OrgItemOn~, ~OrgItemOff~, and
~OrgItemTrans~ for the glyphs, so these can be overriden by the user by adding\\
~#+CONTEXT_HEADER_EXTRA: \define\OrgItemOn{...}~ to the document.

*** Other Features
**** Levels
Many levels of subheading are supported by ConTeXt (up to 9). If more levels are
needed, the user can create them using the ~\definehead~ macro. To handle 10
levels, for example, add \\
~#+CONTEXT_HEADER_EXTRA: \definehead[subsubsubsubsubsubsubsubsubsection]
[subsubsubsubsubsubsubsubsection]~ \\
to the document.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The LaTeX exporter handles arbitrarily deep nesting by treating deeper headings
as list elements, but true headlines are only supported down to 5 levels deep.
