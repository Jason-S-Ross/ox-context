    This seems to be a bug in ConTeXt since I can't get their example

** TODO latex-environment
   I might try to escape/replace really common environments
   and verbatim (or maybe just ignore) anything else. For
   instance, I could probably just do a regex replace to
   go from =\begin{align}= to =\startalgin= and replace all
   the =&= characters with =\nc=

    The cleanest way to do the configuration is to let the
    user use ConTeXt's built-in styling systems. They should
    be able to do quite a bit just by adding extra code to the
    preamble.
